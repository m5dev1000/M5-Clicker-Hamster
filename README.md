# M5-Clicker-Hamster
(V3 ADDED FAKE M5STACK BAN ON B BUTTON RESTART TO REMOVE SCREEN)
I made a Clicker Hamster game which you just click on it. This is my second project in Arduino IDE! (: 
This is just a simple clicker game with a picture of a cute hamster in the background . 
If you want to edit it use the "CLICKERGAME.ino".
The files for flashing it are in the release or the build folder(meanwhile on the build folder only first release m5stickcplus2 exist).
If you want for me to make it on other M5 devices contact me on Discord "goodbucks".

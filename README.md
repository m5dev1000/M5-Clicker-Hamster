# M5-Clicker-Hamster
I made a Clicker Hamster game which you just click on it. This is my first project in Arduino IDE! (: 
This is just a simple clicker game. 
If you want to edit it use the "CLICKERGAME.ino".
If you want to add a cute hamster in the background you need the to use the "HAMSTER_CLICKER_RELEASE" files to flash it in the build/release folders, in order to edit this version use the "CLICKER_HAMSTER_RELEASE.ino".
